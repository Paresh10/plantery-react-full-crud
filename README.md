#### Technologies used:
**React** – Amazing JavaScript library that provides developers super powers of building complex websites easily! Front-end has been developed using ```REACT``` and designed with ```semantic-ui-react```

__Python-Flask__ – Very powerful python flask is the back bone of this website. Beck-end is built by using flask and ample flask's library.

**Sqlite** – Sqlite is structured query language database. All the data during the development phase will be saved in the Sqlite database.

**CORS** – Which stands for cross origin resource sharing, provides the ability to share data and routes from origins. Origin can be host, server and/or browser. CORS makes it possible to cross function the resources.

__Postgress sql__ – Data base is also structured query language database. All the data during and after deployement of this website will be stored in the psql database

#### Forthcoming features:

2. Assuming you have python3. Clone this repository and in your terminal (open separate terminal) navigate to the desired directory where you want clone this repository and run this command source .env/bin/activate. This will run virtual environment in your source directory. All the installation should be done in virtual environment. When you see .env at the beginning, before your cursor in the terminal then you can run this command ```pip3 install -r requirement.txt``` for ```python3```. Which will install all the dependencies from the requirement.txt file. Don't forget to freeze all the installed dependencies by running this command ```pip3 freeze > requirement.txt```.
